Purpose
=======
I made these reference sheets because I found myself needing them and
apart from a MIPS32 quick reference [8] I was unable to find any
instruction set references that would fit a single page and still have
all the details I wanted.
The purpose of these sheets are to get as much information as possible
in a few pages making it possible for someone who already knows the
architecture to have an overview of the instruction set.
I've also tried to use common syntaxes for the instruction descriptions
rather than following some architecture specific conventions to make
the sheets look consistent.


Included Sheets
===============

8086
----
Instruction set of Intel 8086 including execution times for all
instructions. Also includes a quick help for using DOS DEBUG.
Note that this is a pure 8086 sheet, i.e. no instructions or features
added by later x86 processors are included.
Floating point instructions for 8087 are not included.

Note: I was unable to find the execution time for SETALC instruction
      anywhere so the value listed is derived from testing on an actual
      CPU (Fujitsu MBL8086-2).


ARM AArch32
------
A32 and T32 instruction sets of ARM, including version information for
ARM versions 6, 6T, 6k and 7. Also includes floating point and Advanced
SIMD extensions and extra pages with system registers both for
ARMv7-A/R and ARMv7-M.


ARM AArch64
----------
A64 instruction set of ARM up ARMv8.6. Also includes two extra pages
with system registers for ARMv8-A. Debug features and compatibility with
AArch32 has been omitted.
Floating point and SIMD instructions are not included


CRIS v10
--------
Instruction set of CRIS v10 including all memory addressing modes,
execution times and examples for performing multiplication and
division.


CRIS v32
--------
Instruction set of CRIS v32 including execution times and example for
performing division.


MIPS32 R2
---------
Instruction sets of MIPS32 release 2, including MIPS16e and DSP module
rev 2 instructions.
Floating point and coprocessor 2 instructions are not included.


PIC Baseline
-----
Instruction set of PIC baseline devices including extended
instructions.


PIC Mid-range
-----
Instruction set of PIC mid range devices including extended instruction
set.


PIC High end
-----
Instruction set of PIC high end devices including extended instructions.
